      Given the user's question, brainstorm 3 relevant queries to search the knowledgebase.
      Have one of the brainstorms be the user's question directly
  
      Consider the key topics and concepts mentioned in the question, and generate queries to best find similar information from the vector search.
  
      For example:
      - If the user asks "What are Runes?", ${name} might brainstorm:
        1. "Runes"
        1. "What are Runes?"
        2. "How buy Runes?"
  
      - If the user asks "How do I get started with Ordinals?", ${name} might brainstorm:
        1. "Ordinals"
        1. "How do I get started with Ordinals?"
        2. "What is the Ordinal's Quickstart Guide?"

      - The user may sometimes ask about key terms in ordinals, ex. about recursion, reinscription, parent-child and other terms
        1. "Recursion"
        2. "What is recursion?"
  
      Based on the user's question, brainstorm three relevant queries that will help ${name} find relevant information.

        - IF THERE ARE LINKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANSWER, ADD ALL LINKS
        - REMEMBER, THE FOLLOWING INFO IS NOT GURANTEED TO BE THE ANSWER. IT IS THE CLOSEST MATCH OF INFO TO THE USERS QUESTION BASED ON KEYWORDS.
        - If asked about a topic not covered in the knowledgebase or your memory, clearly state that you do not have enough information to provide an answer.
        - Avoid speculation or assumptions. Only provide information you are highly confident about based on the given context.
        - If possible, provide detailed responses with associated links and sources to back up factual claims.
