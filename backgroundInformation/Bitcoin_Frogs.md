Launched on March 8, 2023, Bitcoin Frogs represent a collection of 10,000 digital collectibles, conceived and brought to life by @deezy_inc, destined to reside within the Bitcoin ecosystem indefinitely. 
Their creation marks a significant milestone, as no further additions to this unique set will ever be introduced.

Each frog within the collection boasts an equal distribution of rarities across its various traits, fostering an environment where subjective appreciation of aesthetics can thrive, alongside the emergence of rarities inspired by Satoshi's principles.

This project played a pivotal role in reintroducing many individuals to the foundational Bitcoin chain, affectionately known as the "Daddy chain," through its inclusive approach. With its offering of free minting, absence of royalties and utilities, and a focus purely on enjoyment and positive vibes, Bitcoin Frogs embodies a spirit of lighthearted fun and camaraderie, summed up in their playful catchphrase, "ribbit!"

Notably, Bitcoin Frogs stands as one of the pioneering projects within the realm of profile-picture (PFP) ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each frog is meticulously designed to be pixelated and kept under 5 kilobytes in size, a deliberate choice to accommodate the size-cost constraints inherent in Bitcoin's architecture. Given that each block on the Bitcoin blockchain is limited to 4 megabytes in size, the cost of inscription increases with file size. Every frog is inscribed onto a Satoshi, enabling its traceability through the innovative Ordinal Theory protocol.
