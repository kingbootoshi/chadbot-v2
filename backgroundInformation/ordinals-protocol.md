Ordinals Protocol 
The Ordinals Protocol was created by Casey Rodarmor and allows for the inscription of data onto the Bitcoin blockchain and the attachment of that data to specific satoshis, effectively turning them into bitcoin-native digital artifacts. Ordinals Theory refers to the concept and principles behind the numbering and tracking of satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain.
