what is runecoin

The RSIC project, founded & created by The Rune Dev (https://twitter.com/the_runedev), is a unique concept that merges Bitcoin Ordinals with yield farming. It operates by airdropping 21,000 RSICs, which mine runes by matching symbols with Bitcoin block hash until April 2024. A raffle in April 2024 will distribute 21 billion rune tokens based on mining yields. RSICs are unique digital artifacts linked to early Bitcoin inscriptions, offering a platform for artists to showcase work and for collectors to participate in yield farming. The project ensures ownership and authenticity for collectors through blockchain-based ownership recorded on an immutable public ledger.
